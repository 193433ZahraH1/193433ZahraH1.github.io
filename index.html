    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>Inside the mystery black box, there is a tube that goes straight through to the exit, but also a tube that goes into a spill bucket, which fills up, and spills out when it is full.</p>
    <h1>Evidence </h1>
    <p>The mystery black box is something the class has been observing since the first day of school, but we aren’t sure what is exactly inside. Before we built our own models, we had the ability to do some trials on the black box. We found that there seemed to be no pattern in the data. Sometimes when we poured in 500mL of water, nothing would come out, and other times large amounts of water, over 1000 mL, came out. After observing this data, my group and I theorized that the mechanism inside couldn’t be a tube straight through, because the input was not equal to the output. Within our model, we decided to include a  tube that goes straight through to the exit, along with a tube that goes into a bucket. We decided to do this so that water could either go directly out or into the bucket. When the bucket got too full, it would overflow, which would cause extra water to come out. Other times, all the water could go into the bucket, which would explain why sometimes no water came out. We poured in different amounts of water to see if we would see a difference between our input and output. While our data wasn’t the same as the original black box trial, we did see some similar trends. In one trial we poured in 100mL and no water came out. Another time we poured in 800mL and 1500mL came out </p>
    <h1>Reasoning Pt1 </h1>
    <p> Models are a simpler replica of something in our that gives us a deeper explanation of something we don’t understand or want to explore further. The downside of models is that they are ultimately not the same and they are a simpler version of the real thing. It can give us an estimated idea of how something works but not the exact details. </p>
    <h1> Reasoning Pt2 </h1>
    <p>I believe that our model is similar to what is inside the black box, because we found similar trends in our data. The concept of the spill cup explains why there was sometimes an extra amount of water than what was poured in, along with why sometimes less comes out. In our data, there was no clear pattern, just like the black box! In our model sometimes the overflow would cause our box to leak, which is also something we observed in the black box. <p>
    <h1> Reasoning Pt3 </h1>
    <p> If there was only a tube that goes straight through the model, without the spill bucket, all the water would go straight through the model. This would not explain the overflow, nor would it explain why sometimes no water came out.
